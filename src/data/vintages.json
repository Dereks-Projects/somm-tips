Seek out 2007, 2009, 2012, 2014, and 2019 Pinot Noirs from Russian River Valley, plus 2013 and 2016 Zinfandels from Dry Creek Valley, which represent Sonoma at its most expressive and balanced."

Focus on 2007, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2019 Cabernet Sauvignons and Syrahs, which showcase Washington's signature combination of ripe fruit concentration with fresh acidity and structural precision."

Look for 2010, 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2019 Central Otago Pinot Noirs plus Hawke's Bay Syrahs from the same years, which demonstrate New Zealand's evolution from fruit-forward wines to complex, terroir-driven expressions."

The unpredictability has made great Burgundy even scarcer and more expensive, with some vintages like 2016 and 2021 losing up to 70% of normal production to frost. Pursue 2005, 2009, 2010, 2015, 2019, and 2020 for reds (with 2019 being potentially legendary), while 2014 and 2017 offer exceptional quality in a more classical, elegant style for those lucky enough to find bottles."

The legendary 2016 vintage stands out for its perfect balance and structure, rivaling the great 2010, while 2018 and 2019 offer contrasting styles - the former rich and opulent, the latter fresh and precise.

The clay soils of Pomerol and limestone slopes of Saint-Émilion have proven more resilient to climate extremes than the Left Bank's gravel, with 2015 and 2018 producing particularly hedonistic wines. Seek out 2005, 2009, 2010, 2015, 2016, and 2018 Pomerol and Saint-Émilion, with 2015 offering immediate pleasure and 2016 combining ripeness with classical structure for long-term aging."
